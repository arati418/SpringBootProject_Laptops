# SpringBootProject_Laptops
In this project, we created a database on MySQL. The database table is accessed in a web browser through a Spring Boot Application. We used dependencies such as Spring Web, Spring Data Tools, Spring JPA, ThymeLeaf, and the MySQL Driver. This is a complete full-stack project, meaning it incorporates both front-end and back-end development.
